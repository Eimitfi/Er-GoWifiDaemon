# Er-GoWifiDaemon
a script that allows you to always be connected to internet when connecting to an Er-Go network.

Do you live in one of the wonderful Er-Go's residences and you have a server that must be always connected to internet?
Then you definitely need that trivial script that allows you to do that.
Insert your user and password and run it; I advice running it with nohup/tmux so you'll be able to login to your server through ssh, launch the script and then leave.
